---     fasm-lillypad   (1.3.7)

IMPORTANT       The FASM1 version of the library is depreciated as of 1.3.0

Lillypad is a fasm library implementing basic macros that I commonly use with added syntax nicities.

ldr reg, expr
        Loads the expression `expr' into the register `reg'. Registers are one of the following:
        - rax
        - rbx
        - rcx
        - rdx
        - rsi
        - rdi
        - r8
        - r9
        - r10
        - r11
        - r12
        - r13
        - r14
        - r15

        Expressions are formed with the following CBNF:

                <type>       ::= "byte" | "word" | "dword" | "qword"
                <kinde>      ::= "lea" | "mov"
                <expression> ::= ["~"] [kind] [type] <movable item>

        Where <movable item> is any expression which could be used with a register and the `mov' instruction. Note that the correct register size is chosen
        according to the type given, `dword' is default ([1.1.1] lea may only use `qword'). When allocating a byte typed value to rax, rbx, rcx, or rdx, the
        value is assigned to the `l' variant instead of the `h' variant (i.e., `al' over `ah').

syscall syscode*, [arg]
        Runs the syscall of the value syscode. Each argument after syscode is an expression of the following form:

                <arg expr> ::= "_" ":=" <integer> | <register> ":=" <expression> | "_" | <expression>

        See `ldr reg, expr' for the definition of <expression> and which registers are able to be used for <register>. Syscall begins its register count
        at zero, and for each subsequent argument where a register is not explicitly stated it is incremented by one. It's value determines which register
        is assigned and it may be defined directly with the `"_" ":=" <integer>' production rule. When the argument "_" is used on its own, this value
        is incremented by one, effectively skipping a register, the register order is as follows:
        0: rdi
        1: rsi
        2: rdx
        3: r10
        4: r8
        5: r9

call address*, [arg]
        Calls the function at address. Each argument after address is an <arg expr> of the form described in `syscall syscode*, [arg]'. Note however that
        the register order does differ by one value, 3 = rcx, rather than r10; its values are therefore as follows:
        0: rdi
        1: rsi
        2: rdx
        3: rcx
        4: r8
        5: r9

enter
        Replaces the amd64 instruction `enter' with the following code (this is for speed):
                push rbp
                mov rbp, rsp

lods size* register
        If register is present, moves the result in (size rax) after amd64 lods instruction into specified register

lodstr string
        Where rsi (or `string' if present) is a string of the format defined by the `strdef' instruction, rsi is set to the beginning of dat and ecx is set
        to the length of the string. If `string' is present, it is loaded into rsi equivalently to:

                ldr lea rsi, string

strdef_typed name_expr*, [dat]
        Defines a string with a specified size bit-width and element length. name_expr is an expression of the following form:

                <name expr> ::= <type> <identifier> "[" <type> "]"

        See `ldr reg, expr' for the definition of <type>. The string name will be that of <identifier>, its element type that of the prefacing <type> and
        its bit width that of the suffixed <type>, enclosed in square brackets. Its value in memory, where it is placed, begin with the size (of the bit
        width provided) followed by some number of elements (of the bit width provided) given by dat.

strdef name*, [dat]
        Defines a classical string, equivalent to:

                common
                        strdef_typed byte name [dword], dat

enum arg*
        Defines a set of integer values, each argument is an expression of the following form:

                <enum expr> ::= <identifier> | <identifier> ":=" <integer>

        For all identifiers given without a value, the value assigned is that of the counter. Beginning at zero for the first element, for each element it
        is incremented by one. When an identifier is given a value, the counter is set to that value, and incremented for the next element.

--- Utility functions

        The macro `lillypad_definitions' describes a group of functions. When placed in a text section, one can use the functions here described:


 [1.2.0]        cstrlen(*string)
                        Gives the length of the null terminated string.

        Note that `lillypad_definitions' must be within a `.text' (readable executable) segment.


--- Changes to the `segment' command (1.1.0)

        The segment command works as prior intended, however in the case that only the `.text', `.data' or `.rodata' and no other argument, the following
        mappings apply:

                segment .text   --> segment readale executable
                segment .data   --> segment readale writeable
                segment .rodata --> segment readale

--- Enumerations

        There are the following defined enumerations:

        - The standard files (STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR).
        - The linux x86_64 syscall codes (See flib.inc).
        - The O_ fcntl open flags (O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR).
